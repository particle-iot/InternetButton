/* Let me show you how easy it is to put the Button on the Internet.
Useful info, like how to access the data from your browser, can be
found here: https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#particle-function-

The code to control the number of illuminated LEDs is here:
https://github.com/spark/InternetButton/blob/master/docs/controlKnob.html
Try naming one of your devices "InternetButton" and running controlKnob in your browser or on your phone!
Note that the Core or Photon *must* be named "InternetButton" because the javascript looks for it.
